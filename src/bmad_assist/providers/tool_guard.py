"""ToolCallGuard — LLM tool call watchdog.

Per-invocation watchdog that observes tool call patterns in provider streams
and terminates sessions when runaway behavior is detected.

Three detection mechanisms:
1. Hard budget cap on total tool calls (default: 300)
2. Per-file interaction cap — read+write+edit combined (default: 15)
3. Sliding-window per-minute rate cap (default: 90/min)

Thread safety: check() and get_stats() are protected by an internal lock,
safe for concurrent calls from stream-reader and main threads.
